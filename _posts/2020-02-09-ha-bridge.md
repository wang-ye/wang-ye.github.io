# How Ha-Bridge connects to Alexa
In the past, we mentioned that [Ha-bridge](https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge) is a key component for connecting Alexa with X10 devices, but we did not dive deep into how this is achieved. In the next few articles I will focus on the Ha-bridge functionalities.

## How Philips Hue Bridge's UPNP Works
Philips Hue entered early in the smart home industry. This makes it special. Alexa provides a different approach to communicate with Philips Hue bridge with the help of [UPNP protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/universal-plug-and-play-upnp/). Here is how it works:
1. Hue bridge joins multicast group on port. so later Alexa can find with it.
2. Alexa uses [SSDP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/universal-plug-and-play-upnp/) for device discovery. When Alexa device discovery is requested, Alexa sends a M-search packet to every node in the multicast group.
3. Hue Bridge replies with the information of all devices it manages. Alexa stores the device information accordingly.
4. Alexa finishes discovery.

On the Hue bridge side, it provides rest APIs to trigger different light actions (On, Off, Dim, Color).

Later, when user asks Alexa to turn on light *A*, It will send communicate with the bridge with a "A Light On" request, and light A will be on!

## How Ha-Bridge Works
Ha-bridge simulates a Hue bridge. It treats any device as a Hue device with On, Off and Dim actions. You can associate customized behaviors for each of the predefined action. When Alexa sends a request for a specific action, it will trigger the associated behavior.
