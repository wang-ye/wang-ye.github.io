How does Locust represent a user

Designing of a load-testing system

1. How to issue concurrent requests? supporting multiple machines?

2. Track the status of the requests/response, collect stats, and UI

3. A descriptive language to model the workload

4. Support different protocols - say a rpc-xml server.
