What is the Dao of life? Many people are searching for it. I think it is practicing self-improvement in our daily life. It involves several stages. First, build self-awareness of our own drawbacks. This can come from internal reflections, and external feedbacks from other people. Second, improve ourselves with concrete plans. This can be done via forming the right habits.

I used to think the Dao of life is doing something great, but the challenge here is where to find your mission. With constant self-improvements, we will experience many great things, and our interest and mission will emerge naturally. So keep thinking what you are really interested in while we are perfecting ourselves, and eventually we will find our own path to happiness and success.
