(Cosmic Python)[https://github.com/python-leap/book/blob/master/preface.asciidoc] is about Managing Complexity when Solving Business Problems. Although I only read the first chapter, it is a very delightful read.

In chapter one, it discusses the basics of Domain modeling. Then, it builds a real-world example for modeling furniture fulfilling and shipping. With the help of the domain language, it applies a Test-Driven Development strategy, and cleanly models various concepts such as order, line items and seller's purchase. It also states that `Not everything has to be an object`. Here is the quote from the book:

    Python is a multi-paradigm language, so let the "verbs" in your code be functions. Classes called "Manager" or "Builder" or "Factory" are a code smell.

I plan to read more of the book in the following weeks.
