I deal with a lot with sql queries at work, and one feature I want most is submitting the queries with a hotkey on our internal sql UI.

After a lot waiting, I realized it is best for me to do it myself. Thus, I wrote a simple Chrome plugin called fast_submit, and bind a CTRL + ENTER key to issue the request. Here is the [github link](https://github.com/wang-ye/code/tree/master/chrome/fast_submit).

Enjoy!
