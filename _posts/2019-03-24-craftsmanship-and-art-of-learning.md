In the past two weeks I read two books which inspired me a lot. I want to share some of my learnings in this post.

## The Software Craftsman: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride
The first book is called `The Software Craftsman: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride`. This book changed my view about professionalism and the meaning of software craftsman. It is true that, software development is not the sole factor to product success, and sometimes it is not even an important factor. However, we should never lower our standards and aim to deliver quality software; We should never stop learning new things that make us a better craftsman; and we should never forget we are also a key part of the product success and should provide honest opinions proactively.

This book taught me two great points. The first one is the boy scouts rule - ``Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it``. I really like this. This reminded me that code refactoring and bug fixing are not something we dedicate weeks doing. Instead, it should happen in our daily work and everyone of us should hold high standards to make the codebase better. Another key learning is about professionalism. Professionalism does not mean we can do whatever requirements we are given, but to evaluate carefully about what we can do, and more importantly what we CANNOT do, and then provide options to stakeholders.

## The Art of Learning
Another book I read was called ``The Art of Learning``, the learning story about a chess master turned into a professional Tai-chi competitor. This book helps me better understand psychological piece of being a master.

### What separates a master with a good player?

1. Calmness under pressure separates the best from the ordinary.
2. Easily immersed into their own thinking world, unconscious flows.
3. Able to relax in very short periods before going back to work.
4. Love the work

### How can we train to be a master in our own domain?

1. Attitude to Learning - Believes in incremental theory of intelligence. This also means effort is more important than results, but this does not mean result is not important. Instead, we should learn from each failure and get a lesson from it.
2. Attitude to failure - Cultivate resilient awareness. Fear and loss involves both technical and mental components. We should take care of both; it is important to turn adversary into an advantage, and treat it as the source of inspiration; When making one error, keep a peaceful mind and do not make another error due to the anxiousness.
3. Have humility and openness even when you are mastering.
4. Learn deeply and try to master the basics.
