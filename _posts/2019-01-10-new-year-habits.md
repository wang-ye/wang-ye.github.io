In 2019, I want to form two important habits. Be an early bird, and reflect more frequently.

## Getting Up Early and take the dog for a walk
### Why
Our dog really needs more love from me. For a long time, I get up late and there is no time to exercise the dog. This should change, both for a happy dog and a happy family.

### How
1. Do not make drastic changes - Let's do 8am first, and then gradually cut back.
2. Five seconds to get out of bed - One big obstacle is getting up is too difficult. The plan is to quickly get up and get dressed.
3. Reduce the time between getting up and taking dog out - Once we get out of house, it is difficult to come back :)
4. Reward - you can use the extra hour or two for whatever you want.


## Reflect More Frequently
### Why
I always want to do this, but could hardly find any time. Self-reflection is one of the best ways for building self-awareness and understanding your emotions, strengths, weaknesses and driving factors.

### Why We Failed Last Year
1. We did not realize the utter importance of this
2. We did not allocate enough time for this
3. There is no well-defined way to carrying this.

### How
1. I will allocate a dedicated hour for this every week. Currently set it to Thursday or Friday night every week.
2. The reflection process comes along with a reading session, and compare book knowledge with actual behavior.
3. The reading summary and reflection will be done in a separate job.
