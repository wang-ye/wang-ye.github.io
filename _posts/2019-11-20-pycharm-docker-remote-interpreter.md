Pycharm supports both Docker and Docker Compose mode. I once had difficulty setting up the remote Python Interpreter in Docker compose mode. Every time I ran a Python command, Pycharm would recreate the container, causing a lot of inconvenience. [This thread](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360001791880-python-interpreter-from-running-docker-container) confirmed the Pycharm behavior under Docker compose mode. Fortunately, if I set the remote interpreter under normal Docker mode, then everything works perfectly. I can now run tests without container recreation.
