Designing data intensive systems
stream processing

# why
a big category of data systems

Data with infinite size - user activities, session records, tweets

message systems connecting consumer with producer

producer faster than consumer?

fault tolerance, can replay old messages? idempotent, microbatching and checkpointing

direct messaging VS message broker

logging multiple time for an event

one use case: build search indices

straggler events

exactly once?
