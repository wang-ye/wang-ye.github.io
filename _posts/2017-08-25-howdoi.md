This week I was re-reading [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/) from [Kenneth Reitz](https://www.kennethreitz.org/), and found that it provides a list of code repositories worth learning. Among them, [howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi) caught my attention. It is a small repository with less than 1000 LOC and provides a simple repository structure worth following. On the other hand, it also implements a fun feature - search coding snippets with command line. Today I am going to share some thoughts when reading this repository.

## Howdoi Use Cases
``howdoi`` is a command line tool consulting stackoverflow to identify relevant code snippets for a given query. Here are a couple of cool examples:

```python
$ howdoi format date bash
> DATE=`date +%Y-%m-%d`
```

and another one:

```python
$ howdoi create tar archive
> tar -cf backup.tar --exclude "www/subf3" www
```

## Code Structure
*howdoi* has a very simple code structure:

```
howdoi (module dir)
    - \__init__.py
    - howdoi.py
.flake8
.travis.yml
README.rst
requirements.txt
setup.py
test_howdoi.py
howdoi.rb
```

This structure is quite common - it puts module directory and ``requirements.txt`` in root directory. There is only a root level ``test_howdoi.py`` due to simplicity. One thing worth noting about the structure is, in Hitchhiker’s guide to Python book, it is recommended to use Makefile to automate generic tasks. 

```makefile
init:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
test:
    py.test tests
.PHONY: init test
```

## A Caveat: run code locally?
After downloading the repository, directly run python howdoi/howdoi.py params will raise error like:

```bash
(py35) 08:01:44 ~/github/others/howdoi (master) $ python howdoi/howdoi.py  format date bash --all
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "howdoi/howdoi.py", line 19, in <module>
    from . import __version__
SystemError: Parent module '' not loaded, cannot perform relative import
(py35) 08:01:45 ~/github/others/howdoi (master) $ 
```

Relative importing can easily cause such issues. To resolve, use ``python -m``.

```bash
python -m howdoi.howdoi  format date bash --all
```

## The Internals
The idea is simple. In a nutshell, ``command_line_runner`` gets all the parameters, and calls ``howdoi`` method to find relevant snippets.

```python
def howdoi(args):
    args['query'] = ' '.join(args['query']).replace('?', '')
    try:
        # _get_instructions returns relevant code snippets.
        return _get_instructions(args) or 'Sorry, couldn\'t find any help with that topic\n'
    except (ConnectionError, SSLError):
        return 'Failed to establish network connection\n'

def command_line_runner():
    parser = get_parser()
    # Convert params to dictionary.
    args = vars(parser.parse_args())
    if sys.version < '3':
        print(howdoi(args).encode('utf-8', 'ignore'))
    else:
        print(howdoi(args))
```

``_get_instructions`` does the real job. It first gets a set of links via Google search on the query, and then crawl the links followed by code snippets extraction. ``PyQuery`` is used for extracting the html contents. As a side note, it works much faster than BeautifulSoup.

```python
SEARCH_URL = 'https://www.google.com/search?q=site:{0}%20{1}'
URL = os.getenv('HOWDOI_URL') or 'stackoverflow.com'

def _get_instructions(args):
    # _get_result sends request to Google and return a bunch of stackoverflow links.
    links = _get_links(args['query'])

    if not links:
        return False
    answers = []
    append_header = args['num_answers'] > 1
    initial_position = args['pos']
    for answer_number in range(args['num_answers']):
        current_position = answer_number + initial_position
        # pos controls the index of the link we are interested in.
        args['pos'] = current_position
        answer = _get_answer(args, links)
        if not answer:
            continue
        if append_header:
            answer = ANSWER_HEADER.format(current_position, answer)
        answer += '\n'
        answers.append(answer)
    return '\n'.join(answers)

def _get_answer(args, links):
    links = _get_questions(links)
    link = get_link_at_pos(links, args['pos'])
    if not link:
        return False
    if args.get('link'):
        return link
    page = _get_result(link + '?answertab=votes')
    html = pq(page)

    # Identify code snippet as answers.
    first_answer = html('.answer').eq(0)
    instructions = first_answer.find('pre') or first_answer.find('code')
    args['tags'] = [t.text for t in html('.post-tag')]

    if not instructions and not args['all']:
        text = first_answer.find('.post-text').eq(0).text()
    elif args['all']:
        texts = []
        for html_tag in first_answer.items('.post-text > *'):
            current_text = html_tag.text()
            if current_text:
                if html_tag[0].tag in ['pre', 'code']:
                    texts.append(_format_output(current_text, args))
                else:
                    texts.append(current_text)
        texts.append('\n---\nAnswer from {0}'.format(link))
        text = '\n'.join(texts)
    else:
        text = _format_output(instructions.eq(0).text(), args)
    if text is None:
        text = NO_ANSWER_MSG
    text = text.strip()
    return text
```

## Packaging
Let's talk a bit more about the packaging. The ``setup.py`` file provides important information for installing and understanding the repository. The *entry_points* provides an easy way to start reading the code.

```python
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'howdoi = howdoi.howdoi:command_line_runner',
        ]
    },
```

## Takeaways

1. ``howdoi`` serves as a template to follow when creating small packages.
2. Use _single_underscore_method to indicate methods only for internal use. When a from howdoi import * is called, the _single_underscore methods are not imported.
3. PyQuery package is pretty powerful - Jquery syntax, also much faster than counterpart BeautifulSoup.
4. Running repository locally with `-m` to bypass local import issues.
