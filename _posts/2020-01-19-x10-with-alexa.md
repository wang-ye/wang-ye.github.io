# X10 Renovation With Alexa
Our current home installed X10, the very old first generation smart home system. X10 uses power line to send the control signals. From Wiki,

    Household electrical wiring which powers lights and appliances is used to send digital data between X10 devices. This data is encoded onto a 120 kHz carrier which is transmitted as bursts during the relatively quiet zero crossings of the 50 or 60 Hz AC alternating current waveform. One bit is transmitted at each zero crossing.

When we moved in, the house was equipped with a Wifi module called [WM100](https://www.x10.com/wm100.html). With this, you can control the lights with a simple app, but it is still a bit inconvinient.

The game changing event happened when I got a Alexa as a white elephant gift right before Christmas. I then decided to integrate X10 with Alexa so the control will be a lot smoother. There is a good [tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Control-X10-Devices-With-Amazon-Echo-or-Goo/
) regarding the integration. The [article](https://coreyswrite.com/uncategorized/amazon-echo-x10-home-control-updated/comment-page-2/
) is also helpful. In the rest of the post, I want to discuss the overall architecture for the integration and the hardwares/softwares for it.

# The Integration

I use a [Rasperberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), the mini computer for the integration. I also used the following hardwares:

* [CM17A Firecracker](https://www.x10.com/cm17a.html): It sends signals to X10 transceiver, and turn the lights on or off.
* [TM751 transceiver](https://www.x10.com/tm751.html): It receives the signals from firecracker, and then send the signals to the controllers via powerline. It has to be attached your power outlet.
[HR12A Remote controller](https://www.amazon.com/X10-HR12A-PalmPad-Remote-Control/dp/B00022OCC8): Optional, but it is useful when you are testing the new system.

For softwares, you will need:
* [Bottlerocket](http://www.linuxha.com/bottlerocket/): the software to send user command to serial ports
* [ha-bridge](https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge): This is the key system to connect Alexa with X10.
