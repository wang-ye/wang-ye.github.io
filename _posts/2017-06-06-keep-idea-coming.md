My new year resolution is writing one hundred blog posts. However, so far I only finished a quarter. What's worse, I noticed a recent slowdown of my blogging speed. Several reasons contribute to this slowdown. First, I am getting lazier and could not find enough time blogging. second, my daily job takes a lot of time to finish, and third, I always want to produce "the perfect writeup", which involves revising it again and again. This costs a lot of time.
 
When seeking a cure to get up to speed, a very recent article regarding [prolific](http://prolifiko.com/prolific/) caught my attentions. It studies the creative people in the history and find that the most creative people also happen to be the most prolific. Here is a quote:
 
>In all likelihood, Edison never knowingly worked on something he thought was going to be an almighty flop. He probably worked on his paranormal paraphernalia with just as much vigor as he did the movie camera (which he also invented). He just just kept putting things out in the world until he had a hit. And it’s the same with writers.
>Whilst it’s difficult to believe that Shakespeare wrote any duds, let’s not forget that he wrote close to 40 plays and over 150 sonnets. Can you name them all?  Also, authors like Alexander Dumas, might be world-famous for writing The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Christo but let’s remember that he wrote a total of 277 novels over his lifetime – six every year of his working life. Clearly, not every book had quite the same mass appeal.

In the future, I plan to be more *productive*. I will not seek for completeness and mark post as done once major points are covered. By doing this, hopefully I can keep the ideas coming.
