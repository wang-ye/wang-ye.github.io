Time to write something about the new year resolution again! 2019 will definitely be a year of change and lots things would happen :) In this post I will take the time to review our past achievements, things for improvement, and new year plans.

## 2018 In Review
At the beginning of 2018, I wrote the post [2018 Resolutions](https://wang-ye.github.io/2018/01/02/year-summary.html). Now let's take a look! All the completed items will be marked by strikethrough.

1. ~~More coding projects: golang, JS~~ (Finished js courses, widely used in both personal and company projects)
2. ~~Learn more on blockchain technologies~~ (I did, and wrote bots for bitcoin trading, but turned out this is a hype ...)
3. Coursera courses: None done...
4. ~~Pair programming and debugging is very good learning strategy. Try to have one or two sessions each week about pair working.~~ (Now I set up regular sessions for team pair programming.)
5. One book per month: This is only partially done. Read a couple of tech books and some novels.
6. ~~Lose ~12 pounds in 2 months with more healthy diet and swimming~~ (Indeed I lost about 13 pounds, although it happened at the end of 2018!)
7. ~~More time with wife and family. I want to create more MOMENTS and HIGHLIGHTS. Will plan four formal dinners.~~ (Planed two trips with family and multiple events, happy!)
8. I want to learn one new thing every day - something I never tried before or heard of. I can be food, drinks, knowledge, person, places â€¦.
9. Daily reflection: 3 minute summary of planning and activities every day
Habits to be a better developer?
10. Set up weekly and monthly milestones to review the goals and activities.

In addition to the above, I also completed the following:
1. Become an active Github contributor. In 2018 alone, I open sourced several code repositories, drawing interests from tens of people and helping them solve their real need.
2. I successfully converted a couple of my ideas into reality, and find it really fun! Currently working on some content creator stuff and hope it can fly.

To summarize, On technical and work side, the goals are mostly hit, but long-term habits are really hard to build. The single biggest learning? Always check for goals and milestones!

## 2019 Resolutions
### Personal development
* Join the flock - I want to participate more. Not just watching outside. Github contribution is a good starting point :)
* Expand your personal network - do not be a stranger.

### Habit Development
* Instead of having daily reflections, I plan to do a weekly reflection.
* Develop a healthy exercise habit. Currently already playing badminton regularly. Plan to have at least 15 hiking events during 2019.
* Book reading: Read at least 10 books in 2019 (any kind though). Write at least three reading summaries. Similarly for movies, be an active participant in the community. Write at least two movie reviews in 2019.

### Career
* The art of goal setting
* Learn how to sell your ideas and influence others
* It is now time to think about my career. What should I do next?

### Technical
* Devops - Docker deeper understanding, docker swarm and k8s.
* Learn one more programming language and complete at least one project with it!

### Personal Life
* Time to have a bigger family :)
* Wrap up the personal projects
