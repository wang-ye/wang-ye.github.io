# 2020 New Year Resolution
2019 is the gone. It is time to embrace the new era!

# 2019 Retrospection
2019 is a bittersweet year for me. The best news so far is our little one is born. There are also lots of struggles and fun moments worth remembering, but I want to cut it short to only discuss some of the most important things.

## Things doing well
1. Read more than 30 books this year ranging from technical, management, fiction. It is a big achievement to resume my reading habit.

## Things not doing so well
1. Being intentional for expanding the network, both social and working
2. Not really having a monthly retrospection. I will strive to start it in 2020.


# 2020 Resolution
There are lots of open questions that cannot be answered at this moment.

## Family
Open questions - How to better raise the baby and support the family? This may take multiple years to master, but it is the time.

## Continue Doing
1. The blog
2. Reading

## Develop
1. 7:30am alarm
2. Set up an App for reading books and notes taking.

## Careers
1. Time to start something new.
2. Think about What I want to be in the next 5 years, and start planning for it.

## Psychological
1. Stay motivated, even the reality is not that sweet.
2. Stay focused. In 2019 I experimented many ideas but none of them really flies. In 2020, I want to stay focused and just work on one or two personal projects.
