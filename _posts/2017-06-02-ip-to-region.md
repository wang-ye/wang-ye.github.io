>Question: given an IP, how can we tell the corresponding country, state and city?

You may also be curious about how this is implemented. This [IP to Region](https://github.com/lionsoul2014/ip2region) project answers the above question. Basically, the mapping can be done with a simple IP to region mapping file with only a couple of Megabytes. For China, the mapping supports IP to a specific city, for rest of the world, the mapping is at country level.

The data file is in Chinese. I may consider translating it sometime in the future though.
