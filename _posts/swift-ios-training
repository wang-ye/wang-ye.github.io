I participated an Swift/iOS training. There are some mobile requests, but our team does not have mobile engineers. Also, learning iOS programming is useful for writing hobby Apps. Here I want to share some of the experiences.

The training takes about 6.5 days in total.

For the first two days - Swift, for the remaining 4.5 days - iOS


Frankly speaking, Swift does not give me lots of surprise. It is a relatively easy language to learn and use. XCode also provides powerful support for writing Swift code.
Some learnings include

Builtin collections are all implemented by structs, and are passed by values, while the UI framework is in classes, and are passed by references.

Optionals: Similar to Java, it also has Optional type.

Closures: Swift was extensively used to handle event-driven UI programming, and closures are key for event-driven programming. It has a couple of unique syntax when using closures, but the concept is the same.

Guard syntax sugar for error handling.
