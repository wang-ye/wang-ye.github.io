I read a small book named "The Unwritten Laws of Engineering" from company's bookshelf. It is less than 50 pages, but contains valuable advices on engineering careers. This book focuses on the non-technical part of the engineering life. I will just quote the book directly:

**The chief obstacles to the success of individual engineers or a group of engineers are of a personal and administrative rather than a technical nature. It was apparent that both he and his associates were getting into much more trouble by violating the undocumented laws of the professional conduct rather than committing technical sins against the well documented laws of science.**

Some of the key learnings:

1. As an engineer, the major rules are:
* Demonstrate the ability to get proactively things done
* Speak up - promote your ideas and express yourself.
2. Working with supervisor: 
* The most important thing is, let your manager know what’s going on! Keep him updated on all major decisions.
* Whatever your supervisor wants done takes top priority.
3. Work with colleagues:
* Ask for opinions and recommendations
* Do not do other people’s job unless you manager supports you.
4. One of the most valuable personal traits is getting along with all kinds of people, but do not be too affordable.
