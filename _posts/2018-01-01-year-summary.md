## Summary of 2017

### Biggest achievement
I started writing this blog. Now I really enjoy blogging.

### 2017 Highlights 
It must be the year-end family trip to Hawaii. Lots of good memories

### Learning Summary
In 2017 I am proud to learn the following stuff:

* Code reading
* Learned a lot of blockchain stuff, and how bitcoin works.
* Web development
* Replication and consistency

### Lifestyle Summary
I learned swimming with a six-session lesson. It is indeed a great way to be healthy. Will continue swimming in 2018.

### Need improvement

* Regarding getting up early, I woke up really early in the first 10 months. In the last two months, I did not keep up the good habit. This is also a focus of 2018. Thanks to our lovely dog, I had to wake up early most of the time!
* Losing weight - it is always difficult. In 2017 the weight control was successful at first half. Two factors contributed to this failure. With knee injury, I did not actively exercise. Also, I ate too much every day, especially during dinner. The body weight increased 10 pounds. Also, I ate too much...

## 2018 Resolution
In 2018 I will focus on three aspects - learning, reading and lifestyle. I Will adjust some of the goals with a month.

### Learning

* More coding projects: golang, JS
* Learn more on blockchain technologies
* 2 Coursera courses

### Reading

* Do more paper reading to catch up with new frontiers
* One book per month

### Lifestyle

* Lose ~12 pounds in 2 months with more healthy diet and swimming
* More time with wife and family. I want to create more MOMENTS and HIGHLIGHTS. Will plan four formal dinners. More details come later.
