Recently I read several books regarding management skills. In this blog I want to talk about some learnings from two books, the *Founder's mentality* and *High-output management*.

## Founder's mentality
What are some common traits for successful companies still ran by founders? The authors studied them and summarized three defining traits:

1. insurgent
2. owner's mindset
3. frontline obsession

My personal understanding, Insurgency is about having bold mission, stick to it and keep exploring the limitless horizons. This answers the "*why*" part of running a successful business. Owner's mindset asks us to act as the real owner of the company, and this characterizes "*How*" we should work. Finally, frontline obsession states that we should focus the frontline, customer-facing operations, and first-line employees. This actually tells us *what* we should pay more attentions to.

As the title suggests, this book is more about mentality, not actual action items you can directly apply to in your management career. In fact, you can find close connections with the culture values for many tech companies. Take Airbnb for example. Airbnb currently has four core values. You can find straightforward mapping between the founders mentality and Airbnb's core values.

1. Insurgency maps to "Embrace the adventure", and "Champion the mission"
2. Owner's mindset maps to "Be a cereal entrepreneur"
3. frontline obsession maps to "Every frame matters" and "Be a host"

## High-output Management
As to a more down-to-earth guide for how to be a manager, the "high output management" provides many useful tips on being a manager. Instead of talking about the big slogans, it uses plain words to discuss how to operate a team and a company. The following are some of my biggest takeaways:

1. Set up routine process for most tasks. It is important to cover majority of your work in the routine meetings.
2. Have one or two core metrics to monitor the actual performance of teams
3. Understand the leverage of managers. As a manager, your impact has both direct and indirect aspects. The indirect impact will become more important as the team grows.
4. Meeting tips, and how to conduct 1o1 effectively

# What to improve on
1. Proactively request for feedback and act on it
2. Build a learning organization
