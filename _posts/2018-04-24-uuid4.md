## What is UUID
It is a 128-bit [Universally Unique Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier). To quote Wiki,

```
In its canonical textual representation, the sixteen octets of a UUID are represented as 32 hexadecimal (base 16) digits, displayed in five groups separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12 for a total of 36 characters (32 alphanumeric characters and four hyphens). For example:

123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000
xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
The four bits of digit M indicate the UUID version, and the one to three most significant bits of digit N indicate the UUID variant. In the example, M is 1 and N is a (10xx), meaning that the UUID is a variant 1, version 1 UUID; that is, a time-based DCE/RFC 4122 UUID.
```

## Python UUID4 Implementation
Python uses `urandom` system call to get the UUID4.
The following code snippet illustrates how [Python UUID library](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Lib/uuid.py) builds UUID4.

```python
version = 4

a = os.urandom(16)
intv = int.from_bytes(a, byteorder='big')
intv &= ~(0xc000 << 48)
intv |= 0x8000 << 48
# Set the version number.
intv &= ~(0xf000 << 64)
intv |= version << 76
hex = '%032x' % intv
print('%s-%s-%s-%s-%s' % (hex[:8], hex[8:12],
    hex[12:16], hex[16:20], hex[20:]))
```
