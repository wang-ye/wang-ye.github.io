One of my favorite open source shell utilities is [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump). It memorizes the directories you visited before, and quickly jump to the destination with just a couple of finger clicks. For example, if you have previously visited a deeply nested directory /usr/abc/def/g/h/i/jkl/ using

```shell
cd /usr/abc/def/g/h/i/jkl/
```

Then, you can quickly jump to the directory using the command

```shell
j jkl
```

Sounds like Magic? What happens is, every time you change directory by calling 'cd path', autojump records the change in "Stat file". Later, when you want to jump to a directory, it evaluates your fuzzy input against the existing directories in the Stat file, and find locations you are most likely to visit.
There is one caveat though - **Directories must be visited before they can be jumped to**. 

autojump supports multiple shells, such as bash, zsh, fish and zcsh. In this post we will only discuss its bash support on Ubuntu 16.04. I will cover the following topics:

1. autojump command alias.
2. autojump core data structure - the Stat file.
3. How "cd" command updates the Stat file.
4. How autojump decides the destination.
5. Path autocomplete feature.

## Command Alias
Let's start with the four commands autojump provides - *j*, *jo*, *jc* and *jco*. Here is the example usage:

1. j foo: jump to a directory that contains foo.
2. jo foo: Open the file manager for directory foo.
3. jc bar: Similar to "j" command, but restrict to a child directory containing "bar".
4. jco bar: Similar to "jo" command, but restrict the destination to a child directory containing "bar".

They are essentially simple shell functions defined in *autojump.bash*. Take the *j* command as an example:

```shell
# In /usr/share/autojump/autojump.bash
j() {
    # Skip error handling code for simplicity.
    output="$(autojump ${@})"
    if [[ -d "${output}" ]]; then
        echo -e "\\033[31m${output}\\033[0m"
        cd "${output}"
    fi
}
```

The *j* command takes the string parameter (or a list of strings) and in turn triggers autojump command. autojump then returns the matched path and change the directory to that path. The other commands work in a similar way, and I will skip them for the sake of time.

## The Core Data Structure - Stat File
Stat file is a key concept in autojump. It contains the directories autojump manages. The directories are ranked on visiting frequency. The curious minds might wonder where autojump stores the previously visited directories. In fact, autojump provides an introspection mechanism by simply calling "j --stat". The command displays the Stat file content, as well as the Stat file location. Here is a sample output:

```text
# Weight  Directories
10.0:   /usr/share/autojump
14.0:   /home
20.0:   /home/user_name/Documents
20.0:   /home/user_name/github
22.0:   /home/user_name/Downloads

96:     total weight
5:  number of entries

data:    /home/user_name/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt
```

As you can see, the *data* entry contains the location of the Stat file. Each directory in the file is assigned a weight, which is computed based on visiting frequency. User can also fine-tune these weights. The higher the weight, the more likely the corresponding directory is chosen. Again, note that **only directory in Stat files can be selected by autojump!**

## How 'cd' Command Triggers Stat File Update?
As a follow-up question, you may wonder how a system **cd** command triggers Stat file update. The truth lies inside a bash script called autojump.bash:

```
# In /usr/share/autojump/autojump.bash
case $PROMPT_COMMAND in
    *autojump*)
        ;;
    *)
        PROMPT_COMMAND="${PROMPT_COMMAND:+$(echo "${PROMPT_COMMAND}" | 
        awk '{gsub(/; *$/,\"\")}1') ; }autojump_add_to_database"
        ;;
esac
```

Basically, it utilizes the environment variable *PROMPT_COMMAND*. Elements in *PROMPT_COMMAND* are called every time before Bash displays the prompt message. On the other hand, autojump_add_to_database, the shell command defined in autojump.bash, would call "autojump --add" for adding path and updating weights in the Stat file. The **--add** condition would trigger the add_path method:

```python
# In /usr/share/autojump/autojump
def add_path(data, path, weight=10):
    """
    Add a new path or increment an existing one.
    os.path.realpath() is not used because it's preferable to use symlinks
    with resulting duplicate entries in the database than a single canonical
    path.
    """
    path = unico(path).rstrip(os.sep)
    if path == os.path.expanduser('~'):
        return data, Entry(path, 0)

    # Weight is sqrt(sum_of_all_weight_squares)
    data[path] = sqrt((data.get(path, 0) ** 2) + (weight ** 2))

    return data, Entry(path, data[path])
```

add_path returns a map of format (directory, weight). The more you use a path, the higher the weight, and the more likely autojump will choose it as the default destination.

## How Autojump Finds Paths
Now let's move to autojump's path selection logic. The fundamental question is, given the list of managed directories in Stat file, how can we rank the directories based on frequency? It turned out the logic is fairly straightforward: 

```python
Entry = namedtuple('Entry', ['path', 'weight'])

# In /usr/share/autojump/autojump
# entries is a list of Entry, containing path and weight attribute,
# while needles is the user input strings for matching.
imap(attrgetter('path'), find_matches(entries, needles))
```

The method find_matches() returns a list of matching Entries. **imap** method would then extract the path attribute from each entry. As to find_matches implementation:

```python
# In /usr/share/autojump/autojump

# Removed the utility method such as path_exists and is_cwd for simplicity.
# Returns: A iterator of (Directory, Weight) named tuples.
def find_matches(entries, needles, check_entries=True):
    """Return an iterator to matching entries."""
    # Sort by path weight first.
    data = sorted(
        entries,
        key=attrgetter('weight'),
        reverse=True)

    return ifilter(
        lambda entry: not is_cwd(entry) and path_exists(entry),
        chain(
            # Use different match method to get the matching path.
            match_consecutive(needles, data, ignore_case),
            match_fuzzy(needles, data, ignore_case),
            match_anywhere(needles, data, ignore_case)))
```

*find_matches* first sorts directories by weight, and then matches the user-provided input against the sorted directories using different matching algorithms (consecutive, fuzzy and anywhere). The algorithm names are pretty descriptive and thus I will skip.

## Path Autocomplete
autojump also implemented its own bash completion. It is achieved via [Bash programmable completion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion.html).

```Shell
# enable tab completion
_autojump() {
    local cur
    cur=${COMP_WORDS[*]:1}
    # $cur is the user input.
    comps=$(autojump --complete $cur)

    # Shows the messages returned by autojump --complete $cur in Bash.
    while read i; do
        COMPREPLY=("${COMPREPLY[@]}" "${i}")
    done <<EOF
    $comps
EOF
}
complete -F _autojump j
```

Here, "complete -F _autojump j" means when tab to complete a *j* command, the Bash would use the customized *_autojump* method to complete this command. Essentially, *_autojump* populates COMPREPLY environment variable using the output from "autojump --complete" command. COMPREPLY contains all the candidates *j* can accept, and displays them in bash shell!

The "--complete" argument triggers **handle_tab_completion** method.
**handle_tab_completion** again calls find_matches method to get at most 9 matches, and send the possible matches to stdout. Here is the code:

```python
# In /usr/share/autojump/autojump
# Only keep the major logic for simplicity.
def handle_tab_completion(needle, entries):
    # Print out at most 9 matched paths. print_tab_menu send the paths to
    # stdout, which is later captured by COMPREPLY variable for autocompletion.
    print_tab_menu(
        needle,
        take(9, find_matches(
            entries,
            [needle],
            check_entries=False)),
        '__')
```

## Autocomplete Duplicates

As of release-v22.5.1, autojump gives duplicates during autocomplete.
As an example, if we want to jump to *autojump* source directory, we would first type

```Shell
j auto
```

and then type TAB for autocomplete, the Bash would show the following:

```
auto__1__/usr/share/autojump
auto__2__/usr/share/autojump
auto__3__/usr/share/autojump
```

The same path appears three times! This is because autocomplete triggers find_matches method, which calls three different matching algorithms:

```python
chain(
    # Use different match method to get the matching path.
    match_consecutive(needles, data, ignore_case),
    match_fuzzy(needles, data, ignore_case),
    match_anywhere(needles, data, ignore_case)))
```

The different match algorithms can yield same directory, thus the duplicates.

## Summary
autojump is a powerful productivity tool. I hope you like it. For installation instructions, refer to this [README](https://github.com/wting/autojump). 

The autojump implementation is simple and clean. It provides a good example for writing a utility that supports different shells. The bash tricks such as programmable completion and command callback are very useful. Hope you enjoy it!
