In the past month I was busy working on a project deadline. Now that the project was shipped, I am back to the blogger life!

I will start simple and short. Everyone should have heard of the snake game. The question is: can you find a way for the snake to eat all the eggs? The answer really depends on the structure of the board. But basically, as long as you can find a [Hamiltonian cycle](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HamiltonianCycle.html) traversing all the board grids exactly once, you can eat the eggs successfully. For cleverer algorithms, refer to this [github repo](https://github.com/stevennl/Snake#ai-based-on-graph-search)!
